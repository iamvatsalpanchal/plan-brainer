# 🧠 Plan-Brainer {University Final Year Project}🤖 
AI floor plan generator web application.

## ✨ About the project:
- The PlanBrainer AI floor plan generator is an innovative system designed to assist architects
and real estate developers in creating high-quality floor plans quickly and accurately.
- A project that leverages deep learning algorithms to analyze design patterns, construction codes, and
building regulations to generate customized floor plans

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, ReactJS, React-Three-Fiber(RTF)
- Backend: Flask
- Algorithms: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks(CGAN) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
